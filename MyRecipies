Preheat oven to 325°F / 165°C / Gas mark 3.
Butter and flour a 6-cup Bundt Pan. You can also use 2 x 6-inch round cake pans.
In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. And set aside.
Pro tip - Sifting the flour will give a light and airy texture to the cake.
In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Pro tip - We want to add some volume in the batter and the sugar completely dissolved. So, make sure to cream well.
Add the eggs, one at a time. Then, add the vanilla extract.
Pro tip - Ensure the eggs are at room temperature or the batter will curdle. If that happens, just add a tablespoon or two of flour and combine well.
Followed by the flour and buttermilk in three batches.
Pro tip - The batter looks a bit stiffer than regular vanilla cake. But do not be tempted to add more milk or the cake might sink.
Scrape the sides of the bowl, ensure you have a smooth batter. Pour into prepared bundt pan. Spread evenly with a spatula. Tap a few times to remove any air pockets.
Bake for 40 to 45 mins until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then invert on a cooling rack and cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, with milk, and other flavorings. Stir until you have a thick pouring consistency. Pour over cooled cake (warm cake will melt the glaze).
Pro tip - You want a thick glaze. So, start with less milk, then, add as necessary to bring to consistency.
This cake will stay at room temperature for up to 3 days.
Wrap well and keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.
Also, you can wrap it well and freeze it for up to a month.
