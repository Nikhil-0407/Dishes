Butter - I prefer to use unsalted butter so I can control the quantity of salt in my recipe. And yet, if salted butter is all you have, go ahead and use it. Just omit salt in the recipe.
White sugar - White sugar contributes to a nice soft tender crumb and gives a nice color. You can add brown sugar it will contribute to taste and color differently. 
Eggs - Always use large size eggs when baking unless specified. The size of the eggs varies these days significantly. So as a guide one large egg weighs between 50 to 60 grams.
Vanilla - A good quality vanilla will make a huge difference in anything you make. Premium vanilla can be expensive, which is why I make my homemade vanilla extract, bean paste or sugar.
Flour - Cake flour gives wonderfully moist cakes with tender crumbs but you can certainly use the same amount of all-purpose flour.
